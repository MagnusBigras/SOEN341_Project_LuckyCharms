# Figma Design System

This Figma prototype represents the global design system for the webapp, covering:

- Student Portal  
- Organizer Portal  
- Administrator Portal  

It defines consistent **colors, typography, buttons, and layout containers** used across all pages. Individual page mockups were not created; pages follow this unified design system.
