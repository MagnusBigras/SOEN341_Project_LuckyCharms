# SOEN 341 Project : Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Within this project, our team aims to develop a web application focused on managing on-campus events and associated tickets. This will include three different user portals: one for general users, one for event organizers, and one for administrators.

Within the web app, general users have the ability to view events posted by event organizers. Within this list of events, they can apply filters in order to easily search for events that interest them. A user can also interact with these events, clicking on them to view the details associated with the event and book a ticket. Once they receive a ticket, it can be saved to their personal calendar, so that they can keep track of events they have signed up for. Additionally, when a user claims a ticket, they will receive a unique QR code to conveniently store their ticket.

Event organizers are capable of creating events that will be visible to users. The event creation process is simple, a form were the organizer enters important details related to the event, such as: title, date/time, location, ticket capacity, and the ticket type (paid or free). Upon creating an event, the application will automatically create a dashboard for the organizer, allowing them to see useful metrics related to their event. Finally, our application provides built in tools for organizers, such as the ability to quickly export the attendees list to a CSV file and a built in QR code scanner, so that attendees can be checked in through the app.

The administrator portal allows admins to approve users to become event organizers and begin hosting their own events. Administrators can also monitor content and users to make sure that they comply with organizations policies. Additionally, admins have access to the analytics tab, allowing them to view global app metrics.
